## üîß Usage

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Intel CPU (optimized for Intel processors)
- Administrator privileges required

### Installation & Execution

1. **Download the script**:
   ```batch
   intel_cpu_optimization.bat
   ```

2. **Run as Administrator**:
   - Right-click on `intel_cpu_optimization.bat`
   - Select "Run as administrator"

3. **Choose your optimization level**:
   - **Option 1**: Complete optimization (recommended for most users)
   - **Options 2-8**: Individual optimization categories
   - **Option 9**: Security mitigations (advanced users only)

### Quick Start
For most users, selecting **Option 1 (Apply ALL Optimizations)** provides the best balance of performance improvements.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### System Requirements
- Compatible with Intel processors
- Requires Windows 10 or later
- Administrator privileges mandatory

### Safety Considerations
- **Backup recommended**: Create a system restore point before running
- **System restart required**: Most optimizations require a reboot
- **Security trade-offs**: Option 9 reduces security mitigations

### Performance Impact
- Improved CPU responsiveness
- Better multi-core utilization
- Reduced power throttling
- Enhanced gaming performance
- Lower system latency

## üîÑ Reverting Changes

If you need to revert optimizations:

1. **Power Plan**: Switch back to Balanced power plan via Windows Settings
2. **Registry Changes**: Use System Restore to revert registry modifications
3. **Boot Configuration**: Use `bcdedit` commands to restore default settings
